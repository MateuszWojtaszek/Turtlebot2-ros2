CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findecl_build.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ecl_build", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ecl_build" with
  any of the following names:

    ecl_buildConfig.cmake
    ecl_build-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ecl_build" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ecl_build_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ecl_build" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
